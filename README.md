# KNN-Classifier

## PROJECT & DATA
While there are several other Machine Learning techniques capable of solving much more complex problems and tackling grater dimensions of data and number of parameters involved, choosing some of them for this specific task could be considered an overkill. The use of AI must follow a sustainable proposition and justify the amount of time and resources dedicated to its implementation. The KNN model bears plenty of capability to handle the classification of the Iris Flower dataset.

Also known as Fisherâ€™s dataset (Fisher, R., 1936) the Iris Flower set comprehends 150 instances of data containing selected characteristics of three sub-species of the Iris Flower (Vatshayan, S., 2019). It contains individual measurements for each specimen describing their respective petal length and width as well as sepal length and width. There are 50 instances of each species, iris-setosa, iris-virginica and iris-versicolor, and the pattern generated by similar measurements on each of the different species allow for the algorithm to identify unseen examples.
